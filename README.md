# Why

- for myself, to practice memorizing at scale 1. hanzi, 2. pinyin & pronunciation, 3. meaning
- as a quick mini game, in lift, on bus, etc.

# Features

- [x] read data from a [public Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QxzTnhYiBzeFxrF93FIrAyRAu9OeuiSDylt5gB4b2Ik/edit#gid=0)
- [x] random the words and ask for 1. Hanzi input, either by drawing the stroke or keyboard, and 2. pinyin input
- [ ] offline support with manual sync button
